The Full Explanation was designed to fix the problem of when you wish to understand a complicated term X, but the explanation itself has complicated terms A, B, C, D, E, F and so on. Here, as you will notice, certain topics are highlighted in the generated explanation. Clicking those topics will generate an explanation of those topics (AB,C...) in the context of topic X.

What if the explanations of A,B,C have the same problem?
No worries, the same features still apply!
